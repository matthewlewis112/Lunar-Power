1. As a user, I want my audiobook to pause when I fall asleep, so that I can continue listening later.
2. As a user, I want my Roomba vacuum cleaner to run when Iâ€™m in bed, so it can clean without me interfering and bumping into it.
3. As a user, I want my fan to turn off when I fall asleep, so I can conserve energy and save money on my utilities.
