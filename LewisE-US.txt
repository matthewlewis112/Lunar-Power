1. As an audiobook consumer, I want an application that can pause my book when I fall asleep, so that I can save my place.
2. As a rumba customer, I want an application that can make my rumba vacuum only when I’m asleep, so that I might not get distracted when I’m awake
3. As an environmentalist, I want an application to time my devices to run outside of peak hours, so that I can be more environmentally conscious.
